-- 1. names of employees in the Marketing department
SELECT EmployeeName 
FROM Employee 
WHERE DepartmentName = 'Marketing';

-- 2. items sold by the departments on the second floor
SELECT ItemName
FROM Sale JOIN Department ON Sale.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName 
WHERE DepartmentFloor='2';

-- alternative:
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName
FROM Sale, Department 
WHERE Sale.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName 
AND Department.DepartmentFloor=2;

-- try NATURAL JOIN (joins based on columns of same name)
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName
FROM (Sale NATURAL JOIN Department)
WHERE Department.DepartmentFloor=2;

-- try JOIN (without ON, will perform Cartesian product => not what we want here)
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName
FROM (Sale JOIN Department)
WHERE Department.DepartmentFloor=2;

-- 3. Identify by floor the items available on floors other than the second floor
SELECT DISTINCT DepartmentFloor, ItemName 
FROM Department, Sale 
WHERE Department.DepartmentName = Sale.DepartmentName
AND Department.DepartmentFloor <> 2;

-- solution:
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName, Department.DepartmentFloor AS 'On Floor'
FROM Delivery, Department
WHERE Delivery.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName
AND Department.DepartmentFloor <> 2
ORDER BY Department.DepartmentFloor, ItemName;
