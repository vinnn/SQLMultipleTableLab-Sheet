-- Querying multiple tables
-- -----------------------------------


-- 1. names of employees in the Marketing department
SELECT EmployeeName 
FROM Employee 
WHERE DepartmentName = 'Marketing';


-- 2. items sold by the departments on the second floor
SELECT ItemName
FROM Sale JOIN Department ON Sale.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName 
WHERE DepartmentFloor='2';

-- alternative:
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName
FROM Sale, Department 
WHERE Sale.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName 
AND Department.DepartmentFloor=2;

-- try NATURAL JOIN (joins based on columns of same name)
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName
FROM (Sale NATURAL JOIN Department)
WHERE Department.DepartmentFloor=2;

-- try JOIN (without ON, will perform Cartesian product => not what we want here)
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName
FROM (Sale JOIN Department)
WHERE Department.DepartmentFloor=2;


-- 3. Identify by floor the items available on floors other than the second floor
SELECT DISTINCT DepartmentFloor, ItemName 
FROM Department, Sale 
WHERE Department.DepartmentName = Sale.DepartmentName
AND Department.DepartmentFloor <> 2;

-- solution:
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName, Department.DepartmentFloor AS 'On Floor'
FROM Delivery, Department
WHERE Delivery.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName
AND Department.DepartmentFloor <> 2
ORDER BY Department.DepartmentFloor, ItemName;


-- 4. Find the average salary of the employees in the Clothes department
SELECT AVG(EmployeeSalary) AS 'Avg Salary' 
FROM Employee
WHERE Employee.DepartmentName = 'Clothes';


-- 5. Find, for each department, the average salary of the employees in that 
-- department and report by descending salary.

SELECT DepartmentName, AVG(EmployeeSalary) AS 'Avg Salary'
FROM Employee
GROUP BY DepartmentName
ORDER BY AVG(EmployeeSalary) DESC;

-- see the following solution (!!!double quotes!!!):
SELECT DepartmentName, AVG(EmployeeSalary) AS 'Avg Salary'
FROM Employee
GROUP BY DepartmentName
ORDER BY "Avg Salary" DESC;


-- 6. List the items delivered by exactly one supplier (i.e. the items 
-- always delivered by the same supplier).
SELECT ItemName
FROM Delivery
GROUP BY ItemName
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT SupplierNumber) = 1;
-- NOTE: cannot use COUNT() in a WHERE


-- 7. List the suppliers that deliver at least 10 items.
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Supplier, Delivery
WHERE Supplier.SupplierNumber = Delivery.SupplierNumber
GROUP BY SupplierName
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ItemName) >= 10;

-- solution (same result but showing supplier number as well):
SELECT Supplier.SupplierNumber, Supplier.SupplierName
FROM Delivery, Supplier
WHERE Delivery.SupplierNumber = Supplier.SupplierNumber
GROUP BY Supplier.SupplierNumber, Supplier.SupplierName
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Delivery.ItemName) >= 10;


-- 8. Count the number of direct employees of each manager
SELECT BossNumber, COUNT(EmployeeNumber)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY BossNumber;

-- solution:
SELECT Boss.EmployeeNumber, Boss.EmployeeName, COUNT(*) AS 'Employees'
FROM Employee AS Worker, Employee AS Boss
WHERE Worker.BossNumber = Boss.EmployeeNumber
GROUP BY Boss.EmployeeNumber, Boss.EmployeeName;


-- 9. Find, for each department that sells items of type 'E' the 
-- average salary of the employees.
SELECT Employee.DepartmentName, AVG(Employee.EmployeeSalary) AS 'Avg Salary'
FROM Employee, Sale, Item
WHERE Item.ItemType = 'E'
AND Item.ItemName = Sale.ItemName
AND Sale.DepartmentName = Employee.DepartmentName
GROUP BY Employee.DepartmentName; 

-- solution (same result):
SELECT Department.DepartmentName, AVG(EmployeeSalary) AS 'Average Salary'
FROM Employee, Department, Sale, Item
WHERE Employee.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName
AND Department.DepartmentName = Sale.DepartmentName
AND Sale.ItemName = Item.ItemName
AND ItemType='E'
GROUP BY Department.DepartmentName;


-- 10. Find the total number of items of type 'E' sold by 
-- departments on the second floor
SELECT SUM(Sale.SaleQuantity)
FROM Item, Sale, Department
WHERE Item.ItemType = 'E' 
AND Item.ItemName = Sale.ItemName
AND Sale.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName
AND Department.DepartmentFloor = 2
GROUP BY Department.DepartmentFloor;

-- solution (same result):
SELECT SUM(SaleQuantity) AS 'Number of Items'
FROM Department, Sale, Item
WHERE Department.DepartmentName = Sale.DepartmentName
AND Sale.ItemName = Item.ItemName
AND ItemType = 'E' 
AND DepartmentFloor = '2';


-- 11. What is the average delivery quantity of items of 
-- type 'N' delivered by each company?
SELECT Supplier.SupplierName, AVG(Delivery.DeliveryQuantity)
FROM Delivery, Item, Supplier
WHERE Delivery.ItemName = Item.ItemName
AND Item.ItemType = 'N'
AND Delivery.SupplierNumber = Supplier.SupplierNumber
GROUP BY Delivery.SupplierNumber;

-- solution (question understood differently):
SELECT Delivery.SupplierNumber, SupplierName, Delivery.ItemName, 
AVG(Delivery.DeliveryQuantity) AS 'Avg Qty'
FROM ((Delivery NATURAL JOIN Supplier) NATURAL JOIN Item)
WHERE Item.ItemType = 'N'
GROUP BY Delivery.SupplierNumber, SupplierName, Delivery.ItemName
ORDER BY Delivery.SupplierNumber, SupplierName, "Avg Qty" DESC, Delivery.ITemName;


-- -----------------------------------
-- Nested Queries
-- -----------------------------------

-- 1. What are the names of items sold by departments on the second floor? This 
-- was previously solved in the preceding section by use of a join. However it could
-- be more efficiently solved by using an inner query

-- no nesting
SELECT DISTINCT Sale.ItemName
FROM Sale, Department
WHERE Sale.DepartmentName = Department.DepartmentName
AND Department.DepartmentFloor = 2;

-- nested
SELECT DISTINCT ItemName
FROM Sale
WHERE DepartmentName
IN (
  SELECT DepartmentName
  FROM Department
  WHERE DepartmentFloor = 2
); 


-- 2. Find the salary of Clare's manager.
SELECT EmployeeSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeNumber 
IN (
  SELECT BossNumber
  FROM Employee
  WHERE EmployeeName='Clare'
);

-- solution (same result):
SELECT EmployeeName, EmployeeSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeNumber 
= (
  SELECT BossNumber
  FROM Employee
  WHERE EmployeeName='Clare'
);


-- 3. Find the name and salary of the 
-- managers with more than two employees
SELECT EmployeeName, EmployeeSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeNumber 
IN (
  SELECT BossNumber
  FROM Employee
  GROUP BY BossNumber
  HAVING COUNT(EmployeeName) > 2
);

-- solution (same result):
SELECT EmployeeName, EmployeeSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeNumber 
IN (
  SELECT BossNumber
  FROM Employee
  GROUP BY BossNumber
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
);


-- 4. List the names of the employees 
-- who earn more than any employee in 
-- the Marketing department
SELECT EmployeeName
FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeSalary 
> (
  SELECT MAX(EmployeeSalary)
  FROM Employee
  WHERE DepartmentName = 'Marketing'
);

-- 5. Among all the departments with a total salary greater than Â£25000, find 
-- the departments that sell Stetsons.
SELECT DepartmentName
FROM Sale
WHERE ItemName = 'Stetsons'
AND DepartmentName 
IN (
  SELECT DepartmentName
  FROM Employee
  GROUP BY DepartmentName
  HAVING SUM(EmployeeSalary) > 25000
);


-- 6. Find the suppliers that deliver compasses and at least one other kind of item
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Supplier
WHERE SupplierNumber 
IN (
  SELECT SupplierNumber
  FROM Delivery
  WHERE ItemName='Compass'
  AND 1
  <= (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ItemName)
    FROM Delivery
    WHERE ItemName <> 'Compass'
  )
);

-- other solution:
SELECT DISTINCT Delivery.SupplierNumber, Supplier.SupplierName
FROM (Supplier NATURAL JOIN Delivery)
WHERE ItemName <> 'Compass'
AND SupplierNumber
IN (
  SELECT SupplierNumber
  FROM Delivery
  WHERE ItemName = 'Compass'
);


-- 7. Find the suppliers that deliver compasses and at least three other 
-- kinds of item








-- 8. List the departments for which each item delivered to the department is 
-- delivered to some other department as well
